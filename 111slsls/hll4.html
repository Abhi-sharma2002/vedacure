        <h2>Product Introduction</h2>
        <p>Vedanac SP is a combination medicine used to relieve pain and swelling in various conditions like muscle pain, joint pain, and postoperative pain. Thus, it effectively alleviates pain and inflammation in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteoarthritis.

            In Vedanac SP,
            Aceclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and
            Paracetamol is an antipyretic drug. They work by blocking the release of certain chemical messengers in the brain that cause pain and fever.
            Serratiopeptidase is an enzyme which works by breaking down abnormal proteins at the site of inflammation and promotes healing and speeds up recovery.</p>
