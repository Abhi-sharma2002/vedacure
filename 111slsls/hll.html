        <h2>Product Introduction</h2>
        <p>“Vedahep is a combination of Cyproheptadine, Tricholine Citrate & Sorbitol” which belong to the groups of medicines called anti-histamines and bile acid-binding agents, respectively.

            Cyproheptadine is an appetite stimulant. It works by inhibiting the action of serotonin (a chemical messenger) in the hypo-thalamus (a brain region) that helps in regulating appetite.
            
            Tricholine Citrate is a bile acid-binding agent that removes the bile acids from the body. Then, the liver creates more bile acids from cholesterol, which causes a decreased cholesterol level in the body, resulting in weight gain.
            
            Sorbitol acts as a syrup base and also as an osmotic laxative to relieve constipation.
            
            It is used to treat loss of appetite, weight loss and anorexia nervosa (an eating disorder). It is also used to treat weight gain in anti-tubercular and anti-retro-viral regimens.
            
            In children, Vedahep is used for gaining weight, having an inadequate dietary intake or loss of appetite or suffering from anaemia, liver disease or digestive & hepatic disorders. Appetite loss is a state in which an individual has no desire to eat food, which leads to a deficiency of essential and non-essential nutrients.</p>
